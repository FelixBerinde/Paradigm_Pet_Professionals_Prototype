This was a project for my user interface design class. I was assigned to review a website created by an "intern" for a fictitious company called Paradigm Pet Professionals. I needed to go over the functionality, design, and whether or not the website established the stakeholders requirements. After reviewing the website and it's flaws I was tasked with creating a low fidelity wireframe for the website that fufills the stakeholders requirements.  I completed the wireframe in Invision Studio. The second part of the assignment I was given the option of creating a functional prototype.  To practice Bootstrap, an excellent prototyping tool, I decided I was going to create the prototype with HTML/CSS and Bootstrap. The form is not designed to submit anywhere since that was outside the scope of this assignment.  Maybe at some point I will revisit this project and add more functionality for further practice/building of skills. A short time after completing/passing this assignment I discovered Vercel and learned how to deploy this website on there for everyone to see the final prototype.

Below is the low fidelity wireframe that the website was built off of. Other documents relating to this project will not be posted for acedemic integrity.
