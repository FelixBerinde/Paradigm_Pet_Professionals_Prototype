This was a project for my user interface design class. I was assigned to review a website created by an "intern" for an imaginary company called Paradigm Pet Professionals. I needed to go over the funtionality, design, and whether or not the website established the stakeholders requirements. After reviewing the website and it's flaws I was tasked with creating a low fidelty wireframe website that fufills the stakeholders requirements.  The second part of the assignment I was given the option of creating a functional prototype.  To challange myself and learn some more Bootstrap, I decided I was going to create the prototype with HTML/CSS and Bootstrap. The form is designed to not submit anywhere since that was outside the scope of this assignment.  Maybe at some point I will revisit this project and add more functionality for further practice/building of skills. A short time after completing/passing this assignment I discovered Vercel and learned how to deploy this website on there for everyone to see the final prototype.
